                Welcome to my submission for the second web development assignment! This is my take on creating a Pokedex using React, Vite, and PokeAPI.<br />
                For styling, I took inspiration from various Pokédex designs and customized it to fit me.
                Thanks for checking out my project, and feel free to explore the different Pokémon entries!
